hey y'all, this is just a small nix channel i made to have a clear place to
put all my nix packaging little things, instead of spreading them across a
million git repos and then having to manage submodules and stuff (which i
hate...).

because i don't want to have to rigorously maintain them, i don't really plan
on upstreaming any of these to nixpkgs right now. however, if you want to
adopt (i.e. act as nixpkgs maintainer) any of them, feel free to reach out,
it'd make me incredibly happy :D
